                    <h1>WFR RECERTIFICATION</h1>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>The WFR Recertification course is designed to recertify and refresh current Wilderness First Responders. 
                        To meet a variety of student needs, WMA offers two different course models for the WFR Recertification 
                        course.</p>
                    <h3>3-day WFR Recertification</h3>
                    <p>This course is offered in person over three days for a total of <strong>24-30 hours</strong> of class time. Students are 
                        expected to review their previous course literature and come prepared to perform.</p>
                    <h3>Hybrid WFR Recertification</h3>
                    <p>This course is divided into two components: A self-paced, e-learning module (12+ hours), followed by 
                        two days (16+ hours) of in-person instruction. Some students may need more time to complete activities 
                        based on pre-assessment scores to ensure that they are prepared for the in-person session. 
                        Students must register at least 2 weeks before the course date to ensure that there is enough 
                        time to complete the e-learning course work prior to the in-person session. Please review the 
                        minimum technology requirements for the Hybrid WFR course before registering.</p>

                    <p>WMA International invites WFR graduates from other wilderness medical schools to recertify with us.
                        Eligible graduates from other wilderness medical schools must have a current WFR certification 
                        (unexpired or within your grace period) earned in one of the following course types: </p>

                    <h3>COVID-19</h3>
                    <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, WMA International currently accepts one-year on-line extensions of WFR 
                        courses that meet the above requirements. We do not accept online extensions that are greater than one year. 
                        We do not allow students with a certification from an exclusively online WFR (or WFR recertification) course to 
                        attend a WMA recertification course.</p>
                    <h3>WEMS</h3>
                    <p>Only WMA International-trained WEMS cardholders are eligible for WEMS recertification.
                        <br>Note: If you are a WMA WEMS graduate using this course to recertify your WMA WEMS certification, 
                        it is your responsibility to let the sponsor know when registering, and to inform the instructor on the 
                        first day of class.</p>
