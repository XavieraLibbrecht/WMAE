                            where his specialty was creating emergency drills with a focus on self-reliance in first aid and
                            technical rescue.
                            <br><br>Arne lives in Ghent, and as an outdoor person, he has always been attracted to the mountains.
                            Over the last years, canyoning has become his passion in addition to hiking, climbing, and
